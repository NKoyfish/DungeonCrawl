Brief Description: So there has been built an Enemy class that will store 3 methods that 
we will be using such as the __init__ method that will initialize the monsters_name, 
monsters_type, monsters_health, monsters_speed and monsters_strength and the maxhealth 
of the enemy. We will be setting this in the near future allowing the monster to be created.
These will be the attributes being used
Attributes: 
monsters_name (str) - this will be the monsters name
monsters_type (str) - this iwll be the the type of monster that a player wants to battle
monsters_health (int) - this will be the monsters health after it has been attacked
monsters_speed (int) - this will be the ability of the monsters speed
monsters_strength (float) - this will be the monsters strength.
