"""
The project idea is to come up with a dungeon/maze game 
that pretty much consists of a text base system. Nicholas Koy
came up with the idea and we all agreed on the project and it typically 
runs by parsing a file. There will be barriers like walls and creatures 
along the text based maze. 

"""

"""
Potential Methods:

battle(): similar to aardvark battle system.

getScore(): calculated from hunger value and time it took to reach the end and treasure obtained.

breakWall(): player skill limited use that breaks one wall that isnâ€™t essential. (Border)

jumpWall(): another skill could be used in exchange for hunger. Jumps wall if there is an empty space.

revealMap(): Applied if a map is in player inventory.

eatFood(): So that player can rejuvenate.

rest(): Restore health and consume food. Lowers score

run(): Runs from a battle
